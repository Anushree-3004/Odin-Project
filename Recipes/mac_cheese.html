        <h4><i>Step 1</i></h4>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p><p>Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</p>
        <h4><i>Step 2</i></h4>
        <p>Make the macaroni and cheese: </p><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</p><p>Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. </p><p>Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish. </p> 
        <h4><i>Step 3</i></h4>
        <p>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat.</p><p>Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. </p>
        <h4><i>Step 4</i></h4>
        <p>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.</p><p>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper.</p><p>Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed.</p><p>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined. </p>
        <h4><i>Step 5</i></h4>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes. </p>

        <p>If you don't have any leftover cooked rice, here's how to make it:</p><p>Combine 4 cups water and 2 cups white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil.</p><p>Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</p><p>Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.</p><p>For the best fried rice results, cover and refrigerate the rice, 8 hours to overnight, before using in this recipe.</p>
